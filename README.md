# Aila Umalin - Data Analysis Portfolio 

### About
Hi! I am Aila and currently in training to be a Data professional. I have a degree in Communication Research and a background in customer service, order fulfillment, team management, data analysis and reporting, and admissions for the Higher Education sector.

In the duration of my training, I've worked on a few datasets and I've completed a project that utilized both SQL and Excel. I've created this portfolio to showcase my skills in data analysis and keep track of my progress and the datasets or projects I'll handle.

If you'd like to know more about my professional background, please view my CV [here](https://github.com/ailaumalin/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Jonnaila%20Marie%20Umalin.pdf).
